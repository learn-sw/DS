# Given an array and a number k where k is smaller than size of array, we need to find the kâ€™th smallest element in the given array. It is given that all array elements are distinct.

# Example:
# Input: arr[] = {7, 10, 4, 3, 20, 15}
# k = 3
# Output: 7

arr = [7, 10, 4, 3, 20, 15]
print(arr[-1])
for i in arr:
    print([i])
