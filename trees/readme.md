# Dynamic Programming(DP) is a technique to solve problems by breaking them down into overlapping sub-problems which follows the optimal substructure. There are various problems using DP like subset sum, knapsack, coin change etc. DP can also be applied on trees to solve some specific problems.

# variations:

1. general syntax
2. how DP can be applied to trees <identifacation>
3. daimeter of a binary tree
4. max path from any node to any
5. max path serach from leaf to leaf
6. diameter of n-ary tree
