Q4. Time when you took a risk and failed?

    Senario: deadlines 
        distrubuted cache <hazelcast and new relic products> and hep team. 
        As it was initail phase i was voltunerd to deploy both the product. 

        I felt lot of stress when working for the teams.

        For distrubuted cach i was able to write automated test scripts using chef audits 

        there was a scope for automation for some of the modules. were I ccouldn;t write. 
        This was not part of the requirement. but this costed some time for manual testing. 
        we did this work in next sprint.
