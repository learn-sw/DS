# knapsack problem explanation

# what is knapsack?
A bag with shoulder straps, carried on the back.

# what is knapsack problem?
The knapsack problem is a problem in combinatorial optimization: Given a set of items, each with a weight and a value, determine the number of each item to include in a collection so that the total weight is less than or equal to a given limit and the total value is as large as possible.

combinatorial optimization: 

# where does the proble occurs?
The problem often arises in resource allocation where the decision makers have to choose from a set of non-divisible projects or tasks under a fixed budget or time constraint, respectively.

# How to identify  knapsack problem?
Any problems related to bag,  resource allocation like given set of items, weight, values those can be identified as knapsack problem

# Types of knapsack:
1. Fractional 
2. 0-1 
3. unbounded knapsack
